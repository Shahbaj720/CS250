1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I start by gathering requirements through feedback sessions and observations. Turning these requirements into user stories ensures each feature is aligned with actual user goals. User stories help break down complex needs into clear, actionable tasks, making it easier to prioritize and implement the most valuable features first.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I follow an iterative and incremental approach, adapting as I learn more about user needs. I plan to use processes like daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives, which foster open communication and continuous improvement. Regular integration and testing help catch issues early and keep the project on track.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member communicates openly, supports colleagues, and remains flexible to change. They actively collaborate, share knowledge, and respect different viewpoints. By taking responsibility for tasks and offering help when needed, they help the team consistently deliver high-quality software.
